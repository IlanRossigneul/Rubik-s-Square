# Rubik-s-Square

#### Project realized in two days at the end of two weeks of learning in C at the Coding Academy by Epitech.

We were asked to solve a defined Rubik's Square with imposed methods (semi brute force). I decided to improve the program by adding a shuffle to the initialization, delays between each movement and a clear system for clarity.

To display the Rubik's Square, enter the command ./rubiks in your terminal.
